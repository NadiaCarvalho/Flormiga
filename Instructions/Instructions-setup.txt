Instructions:

1. Installing the Raspberry Pi

1.1. Downloads
- Download Raspberry Pi Imager
- Download Image '2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf.img'

1.2. Installing
- Using Raspberry Pi Imager install the image into the sd card
- Create an empty file in the boot folder (SD card) called ssh.txt to setup SSH
- Create an empty file in the boot folder (SD card) called wpa_supplicant.conf to setup Wifi
- Inside the wpa_supplicant.conf insert (substitute text between "" by your configuration):

    country=PT
    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    network={
        ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
        psk="YOUR_PASSWORD"
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
    }

    NT: if your wifi doesn't have a password use this configuration:

    country=PT
    ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
    network={
        ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
        key_mgmt=NONE
    }

- This image already comes with graphical interface, so make the appropriate setup (keyboard, wifi, etc)
- If you want, you can use your own computer via ssh (https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-6-using-ssh/using-ssh-on-a-mac-or-linux)
    - discover ip (ifconfig on raspi)
    - connect on your pc with ssh pi@IP (ex: ssh pi@192.168.1.3) and input password of "raspberry"
    (You can also use pi@raspberrypi.local if there is only a pi in the network)

- Go to terminal and input raspi-config. Select expand_roofts to expand root partition to the whole sd card (otherwise the pi will stop on upgrades, as it doesn't have enough space to update)
- Reboot

1.3. Setup

On the terminal (either inside ssh or raspberry pi) input (by written order):

- sudo apt update
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get upgrade (Reboot after)

- sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip
- sudo pip3 install --upgrade setuptools
